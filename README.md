# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project develops a machine learning model to predict heart disease based on patient data. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and training classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. The goal is to identify the most accurate model for early diagnosis and prevention of heart disease.
